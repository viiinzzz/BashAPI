# BashAPI
_by Viiinzzz_

The idea is simple : leverage .Net Core Web API to run a system command such as a file converter.

So POST a file via http with appropriate argument and get back the processed file.

Of course it's a POC, no special security has been implemented to protect the system.

An application is to add Web API to docker images that don't have one yet.
